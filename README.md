Initial meeting
--

Topics introduced and discussed:
-    the goal of this project
-    context of the projects part in a bigger research project
-    what tools to use
-    Workflow and meeting schedule 

Goal of this Project:
-
We are developing a satellite imagery analysis application that allows users to specify a region of interest and receive an analysis of the percentage of privately-owned yards within that region. This prototype will demonstrate the feasibility of the concept and the potential of the technology.

Context of the Project:
-
The motivation behind our project is to support detecting potential for optimization of privately-owned yards in Germany as a means of combating climate change. We will try to identify areas where there is potential to make privately-owned yards more sustainable. By creating a data basis for choice modeling and utilizing deep learning techniques, we hope to support a research project that will potentially inform and shape political decision-making and sustainability policies in the future.

Which Tools will be used:
-
There is no limitation or specification for which Tools should be used. The only specification at this time is the computer language of python.

The next meeting is set at the 23.01.23, 1 pm via Teamsmeeting
The following meetings and updates to the project will be set on demand. Follow us on our Git-Hub Repository https://github.com/LaurinX/Deep-Learning-analysis-of-satellite-images for our latest updates
